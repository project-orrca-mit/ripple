# ripple
Official Repository of the Project ORRCA RIPPLE Database


NEW IDEA:

## PYTHON API
(1) write python library with API that provides functions that allow a user to input data manually or autonomously into a file format the uploader can read. 

(2) Python API has a "write-file" function that will write the file with the appropriate formatting so the system does not get messed up. API also provides the ability to access file types such as excel sheets (or tables) --> we will see 
IMPLEMENT JSON/XML/SIMILAR...

## UPLOADER/INTERPRETER -data client
(3) The text format is very specific and uploaded to the ripple DATA client that parses through the data and adds it to the online TEXT database. 

## GRAPHER
(4) scripting system will take the data table and update the Googe Earth engine or Google Maps Creator GRAPHING UTILITY every so often and display it

## DATABASE ITSELF
(5) Google sheets or similar text databse as well with SEARCH implementation from the WEB APP



###### More Info:
Few parts:
URL: data.projectorrca.org (maybe)
(1) rippleCODE Python Library allows users  (including us) to use python to write our data to a specified text file format without having to worry about the actual file writingâ€¦
Will have a library with google sheets, xml, kml or json or some other form of support 
Library will have a function write() - that writes the data to a .rpl certified FILE 
(2) rippleDATA Client()
Is an uploader/parser 
Takes .rpl files and adds them to the database (implemented via python on the online database viewer)
(3) rippleDATABASE itself 
Is either a google sheet or similar that allows us  to view the data and store the data parameters in TEXT form 
If it is a google sheet, we will implement a google script custom sidebar/search system to make it look more legit and be more useable
The sheet will NOT be editable 
(4) The grapher/UI
The grapher and UI will be a google earth engine or google maps  creator system 
The UI will be a website itself
It will connect all the above together into one online UI
It will also server as a way to view and access the data
