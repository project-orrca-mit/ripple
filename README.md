# ripple
Official Repository of the Project ORRCA RIPPLE Database


NEW IDEA:

## PYTHON API
(1) write python library with API that provides functions that allow a user to input data manually or autonomously into a file format the uploader can read. 

(2) Python API has a "write-file" function that will write the file with the appropriate formatting so the system does not get messed up. API also provides the ability to access file types such as excel sheets (or tables) --> we will see 
IMPLEMENT JSON/XML/SIMILAR...

## UPLOADER/INTERPRETER -data client
(3) The text format is very specific and uploaded to the ripple DATA client that parses through the data and adds it to the online TEXT database. 

## GRAPHER
(4) scripting system will take the data table and update the Googe Earth engine or Google Maps Creator GRAPHING UTILITY every so often and display it

## DATABASE ITSELF
(5) Google sheets or similar text databse as well with SEARCH implementation from the WEB APP
